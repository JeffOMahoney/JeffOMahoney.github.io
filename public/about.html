<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings, my name is Jeff and I have just started programming. So far, I am loving it. If you’re reading this, then you are interested in my portfolio. This portfolio contains some of my very first coding creations, so welcome and I hope you enjoy the experience.</p>
  
<p>From the course, I hope to achieve attaining employment in the field. I will relish the opportunity to develop and hone my skills further over the coming months and years, and even decades as learning is a life-long pursuit that never ends. So far, I am receiving immense joy from the work that I have performed and look forward to experiencing even more amounts of joy and satisfaction from this great area of creativity.</p> 
<p>So once again, welcome to my first portfolio. This portfolio will no doubt grow with the passage of time. So whatever stage you encounter this portfolio, I hope you enjoy it and take away something from it. Please, don’t hesitate to contact me. Until we meet again.</p>
  
<p>Jeff O’ Mahoney</p>
